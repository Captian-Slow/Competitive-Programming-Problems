## To run the given code:

### Java 8:
* Make sure that you have the JRE (Java Run-time Environment) installed.
* Compile the code by: `javac -d path-to-generate-class-file file-name.java`
* Run the java code by: `java -cp path-to-class-files file-name`

### C++ :
* Make sure that you have the right compiler for your OS. The examples shown here follow the gcc (5.4.0) compiler, but the same _may_ work for other compilers.
* Compile the code by: `gcc -o output-file-name input-file-name.cpp`
* On Unix based systems, to run the file: `./output-file-name`
* On Windows systems: `output-file-name.exe`
